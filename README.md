## Introduction
I’m currently transitioning into cybersecurity after working in the healthcare industry for over 9 years. Technology has always been a strong interest of mine. Nearly 20 years ago, I began learning by repairing computers, building systems, and exploring web development. Over time, that interest grew into a passion for understanding how systems work and how they can be made secure.
Now, I’m focused on learning cybersecurity in a hands-on way. I’m building a home lab, working on projects, and developing real skills through practical experience. My long-term goal is to work in the field of digital forensics and incident response.

## Objective
My goal is to build a solid foundation in cybersecurity by studying key concepts, practicing in lab environments, and completing real-world projects. I’m especially interested in digital forensics, including how to analyze systems after a security incident, recover data, and understand how attacks happen. I'm committed to learning and growing in this field, and this portfolio is where I will document that journey.
